- This repo contains mostly snippets of code for educative purposes, keeping it the most simple and stupid logic exposed, php random stuff, demos, functions, most of these samples are gross but leads the way on how to accomplish some things .. Code snippets are not cleaned, taken from several various projects
- Focus on : "get it done", "keep it simple and stupid" => examples avoid spreading through 36+ various abstract class files maze so students might loose track of what's going on too early ..
- Agnostic and framework free - so compactibility rate is 100% ;)
- Configs are in : app/common.php => $mainHost
- Php default configuration : conf/php56.ini ( short_open_tags, auto_prepend_file )
