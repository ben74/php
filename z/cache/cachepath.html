HTML output of the page using tons of mysql and entities taking such a long time you'll want this block to be cached at least for one hour so your website might serve content instead of enabling such a ddos gate, crashing mysql because lots of connexions, dead process pending sql response, so much apache processes causing crashing at each request, having a load_avg above 99 and opening the road to main system OOM ;)
